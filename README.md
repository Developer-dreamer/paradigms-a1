# Simple text editor 
## Implementation
I was implemented this program using procedural paradigm in C language.
You can find there different files with different functionality.
Each of function defined in Methods.h header for program flexibility, easier reading and refactoring.
There is 10 options which are described in helper variable.
This program can work with files, string arrays, using different functionality for text editing.
## Testing
For program testing you can use next command sequence:
4 - for load the text
1 : Hello world - for inserting text to the end
6 : #hi# : 1 10 - insert text with index
7 : procedural - for finding index of given word
5 - print current state of the text
4 - another try to load text from file to refactor
1 - for sanig current and concatenate text with local
9 - clear the console
0 - end the program
